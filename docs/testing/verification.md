# Testing and verification

This document separates three kinds of evidence: automated coverage known to
exist, gaps that remain, and manual/integration scenarios that are still
pending. An inventory statement records established coverage scope; it is not a
claim that a test, build or game session was run for the current change.

For implementation changes, the tracked verification expectations are to:

- run the relevant automated tests and repository lint, static-analysis, format,
  type, and compile checks;
- build every affected Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge source set, and run
  `verifyModIdentity` when loader packaging, artifact identity, or the complete
  shippable artifact set is in scope; and
- report every command actually run and its result, every applicable check not
  run and the exact reason, manual validation actually performed, and remaining
  manual or integration gaps.

Use the public commands and task orientation in the
[repository README](../../README.md#install-build-and-verify). Local maintainer
or agent instructions may add workspace-specific execution constraints, but are
not a public prerequisite and do not replace these tracked expectations. Never
report rendering, multiplayer, interaction, or other manual behavior as verified
unless it was actually exercised or covered by an appropriate automated test.

For a documentation-only change, check the changed documents' links, headings,
fenced blocks, and affected coverage statements. Report those checks as the
commands or review actually performed; document review alone is not runtime,
build, multiplayer, rendering, or manual gameplay validation.

## Existing automated coverage inventory

### Domain, identity and authority

The current suite covers:

- the fixed Target Type and Ping Type catalogs, including their values;
- numeric-priority and declaration-order Target Type resolution;
- optional-content fail-soft matching;
- target identity and the captured-ray flow;
- Marker ID and marker codec behavior;
- `targetTypeId`, including `entity_block`, surviving marker codec round trips
  without changing the protocol shape; and
- same-target winner selection and recomputation;
- synchronized-deadline and visual-state seams for display expiry and
  expire-fallback behavior through `ClientMarkerDisplayDurationTest` and
  `ClientMarkerStoreTest`; and
- source ordering and one evaluation of each consulted resolver in
  `DefaultTargetResolverTest`.

Marker-store, packet, and update tests provide recipient-scoped state and
channel-mode transport seams, but do not establish the complete `ServerCore`
ordering and channel/admission matrix in a live client/server path. Loader
registration of the legacy and authoritative routes is confirmed by source
inspection for Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge. `MarkerPacketsTest` and
`PacketHandlerTest` cover authoritative packet codec/safety seams, but there is
no direct automated test that a valid legacy location S2C packet is ignored by
`CommonClient`, nor a live cross-loader network test.

### Capture, wheel and cancellation

The current suite covers short press, long press, pending/asynchronous capture,
wheel state transitions, the actual wheel-open boundary and timeout behavior.
`LongPressCompatibilityControllerTest` covers the ordinary rapid-click and
asynchronous deferred-compatibility paths, with focused bounds coverage supplied
by the applicable config-bounds tests. These are controller/config slices, not
real input callbacks or render-frame integration.

`CancelCandidatePickerTest` covers press-ray cone filtering and nearest-candidate
selection, while `ClientMarkerStoreTest` covers owner/dimension retrieval.
Those seams do not runtime-cover a retained stale or display-hidden marker
reaching cancellation and then being rejected by the server without a local
fallback. Frozen press-ray behavior and the pending-capture/wheel interaction
boundary otherwise have focused test coverage.

### Selection-policy and input-state seams

The [selection policy](../picking/selection_policy.md) has focused unit and
state-seam evidence, rather than live input-callback evidence:

- `ToggleInputStateTest` covers physical-press de-duplication until release,
  including suppression of repeated presses before the next release;
- GUI/screen eligibility is exercised at the input-state seam, not through a
  live GUI callback;
- `ClientConfigTargetSelectionTest` checks the disabled defaults for the three
  target-selection toggles and their JSON round trip; and
- `EntitySelectionBlacklistTest` covers registration aggregation, idempotent
  removal, and the optional Create registration boundary, while
  `EntitySelectionBlacklistDefaultRuleTest` checks the default
  `simulated:honey_glue` entity rule and representative nonmatches.

The entity-selection blacklist evidence is distinct from block whitelist,
block-shape, and display-blacklist behavior. It must also not be treated as
raycast-filter coverage: spectator exclusion is implemented by `Raycast`, not
by `EntitySelectionBlacklist`. The unit seams do not establish live GUI/screen
callbacks or loader-specific physical key-repeat behavior.

### Exact entity-local picking and Create raycast seams

Focused coverage exercises:

- an immutable entity-local-geometry owner snapshot;
- owner resolution and `HIT`/`MISS`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`FAILED` candidate rules;
- retention of entity-local metadata only for the matching resolved identity;
- native local block/fluid shape policy and exact-tie behavior;
- the common native local-shape scanner and candidate pipeline;
- the Create-free contraption engine; and
- lazy Create adapter/loading seams and delegate-unavailable behavior.

These tests preserve whole-entity identity and exercise the non-optional engine
boundaries. They do not constitute an in-game Create validation.

### Capture and acceptance range

Focused tests cover server range clamps, native candidate/raycast seams, and
absent optional-integration safety. Source and focused seam evidence establish
the native `min(raycastDistance, pingDistance)` limit, Distant Horizons'
independent trace, the server acceptance range, and Create/Sable reuse of the
finite native segment. No automated end-to-end test exercises that entire client capture,
optional-provider, packet, and authoritative server-acceptance pipeline.

### Presentation, chat, config and geometry outcomes

The current suite covers:

- chat template selection and Ping-Type-phrase-only coloring;
- wheel sector colors;
- block whitelist grammar and evaluation;
- entity-block source modes and per-attempt `RENDERED`/`EMPTY`/`FAILED`
  outcomes, including fallback consequences;
- invalid client-config recovery;
- `ConfigHandlerResetTest` coverage of resetting in-memory values to defaults
  and preserving the bytes of a protected future-version file;
- config-version marker, precedence, migration, client/server recovery, and
  future-version preservation seams; and
- behavioral native-edge rendering.

`PingChatBuilderTest` covers required placeholders, escaping, missing-token and
legacy fallback seams. This does not close localized-name, custom-name, locale,
or resource-fallback scenarios.

`TargetNameComposerTest` covers custom color/italic stripping and base-component
identity. Its event-named case does not construct click or hover event fixtures,
so it is not event-specific regression coverage.

`ClientPingRuntimeTest` covers only the current-local-store membership predicate
before and after a same-ID external-locator upsert. It does not invoke
`applyCreated` or cover corrupt/tombstone suppression, actual sound playback,
GUI chat delivery, or cross-dimension execution.

### Server-settings snapshots and updates

`ServerSettingsModelTest` covers request correlation, stale responses, denial,
draft state, and update planning. `ServerConfigUpdateTest`,
`ServerConfigUpdateServiceTest`, and the focused server-config packet tests cover
field-masked partial merge and codec/handler seams. They do not establish the
live settings UI, permission changes over a connection, actual packet exchange,
or persistence behavior in a running client/server session.

### Render entity lookup and locator resolver seams

`RenderEntityLookupCacheTest` and focused locator-resolver unit seams cover the
render-only lookup algorithm and locator resolver boundary. The cache tests
exercise idle passes without scans; distinct,
repeated-hit, and miss UUID requests sharing one cold index; first-valid
duplicate selection; simulated HUD/outline warm reuse across passes; a different
world object with the same dimension; removed or unloaded entries; runtime-ID
reuse and UUID mutation; same-UUID replacement and a spawn after index creation
becoming visible in a later pass; an invalid warm entry causing one scan and
index build; pruning without touching an old entry during validation; clear/null-frame
handling; and null-world and null-UUID safety.

`EntityOutlineLocatorResolverTest` covers UUID and XP locators, runtime
non-orb rejection, gone/null/mismatched entities, map lookup, and the raw-cache
entity-mismatch seam. Neither this cache test nor these resolver tests are a
dragon-renderer test or establish canonicalization integration beyond their
stated seams. The cache fakes and access counters establish lookup-algorithm
behavior only: they are not actual Minecraft frame hooks, HUD callers, or
renderers, and they do not automatically cover the fresh non-render lookup
bypass. Source inspection remains useful for those call-site boundaries but is
not automated runtime coverage.

### Sable integration coverage

The linked [Sable integration](../integrations/sable.md) topic remains the
behavior owner for [client capture and presentation](../integrations/sable.md#client-capture-and-presentation),
[server validation and materialization](../integrations/sable.md#server-validation-and-materialization),
and [refresh lifecycle](../integrations/sable.md#refresh-lifecycle). The
following focused seams provide limited structural, locator-codec and
diagnostic evidence:

- `SableClientCompanionAccessContractTest` statically parses the compiled
  access-class constant pool, requires the exact
  `SableCompanion.getContaining(Level, Position)` symbol, and excludes the
  exact names `getClientLevel` and `getContainingClient`;
- `SableExternalBlockLocatorTest` covers representative encode/parse
  round-trips and selected malformed, noncanonical, and out-of-bounds cases;
- `SableRefreshLogGateTest` checks decision state for tested locator or reason
  changes and duplicates, rather than a refresh operation or log sink;
- `SableDiagnosticsTest` and `SableServerDiagnosticsTest` check selected event
  metadata and record fields, including same-throwable identity for a server
  exception and constructed-invalid or `LinkageError` cases;
- `SableClientDiagnosticsTest` checks an empty capture result when Sable is
  absent and diagnostic presence from explicit `logCaptureFallback` calls with
  a reason; and
- `SablePresentationLogGateTest` checks cadence, capacity, repeated
  failure-class key de-duplication, and throwable identity.

These unit and bytecode seams do not load a Sable runtime or establish the
provider, materialization, tracking-point reference, live-sublevel refresh,
multiplayer, or in-game behavior described by those topic sections.
The external model and fallback routes also resolve provider presentation
independently; therefore this evidence cannot guarantee that provider-local
multipart or subject-type decisions came from one immutable shared snapshot.
That is an implementation-conformance and automated-coverage gap, not an
external exception to the shared-subject contract in
[presentation subjects](../rendering/presentation_subjects.md).

### Rate-policy courtesy behavior

The current suite covers the create-only client token-bucket courtesy gate,
dropping throttled committed creates without queueing or dispatch tracking,
`MarkerRemove` and channel-update bypass, and corrupt-policy handling. This
client coverage does not close the server and end-to-end policy gaps below.

### Simulated integration coverage

`SimulatedDockingConnectorPresentationResolverTest` covers the stand-in
resolver's connector IDs, facing relationship, powered owner, owner block-entity
identity, and handled-empty result. It does not establish loader registration,
an installed Simulated runtime, or in-game presentation.

### Focused native block-outline regression coverage

The native VoxelShape route requires complementary checks rather than one broad
"outline works" assertion:

1. Production render-state coverage pins `BlockOutlineRenderType` to
   `VertexFormat.Mode.LINES`, vanilla `rendertype_lines`, the fixed 3.75 px
   width, `NO_DEPTH_TEST`/`GL_ALWAYS`, color-only writes and late composite
   submission.
2. Native geometry coverage pins the live
   `BlockState#getShape`-to-`VoxelShape#forAllEdges` edge route so a full-cube,
   polygon or shape-equivalent substitute cannot satisfy the regression.
3. Render-frame snapshot coverage separately exercises late submission and
   frame ownership.

Native-glow whitelist/eligibility coverage is separate from these VoxelShape
checks. Passing either side alone does not prove the other, and structural or
behavioral tests do not by themselves prove actual visibility through occluders
or from arbitrary in-game camera angles.

## Build, source-set and artifact verification

The included Gradle projects are `common`, `fabric`, `forge`, and `neoforge`.
Their loader source sets receive common Java and resources through the shared
loader wiring. Fabric retains the common mixin configuration and Loom-generated
intermediary refmap; Forge and NeoForge use their loader-local official-Mojmap
configuration instead. This routing identifies existing tasks and artifact
purposes only. Public build orientation and commands are listed in the
[repository README](../../README.md#install-build-and-verify); the tracked
[geometry pipeline](../architecture/geometry-pipeline.md) is the public
architecture entry point. Local agent instructions, when present, are
supplementary execution guidance rather than a public documentation prerequisite.

| Module or artifact scope | Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `common` test source set | `:common:test` | Runs the common JUnit Platform tests, including shared behavior and integration seams. |
| `neoforge` test source set | `:neoforge:test` | Runs the NeoForge JUnit Platform tests, including NeoForge-specific resolver coverage. |
| Affected loader source set | `:fabric:build`, `:forge:build`, or `:neoforge:build` | Builds the affected Fabric, Forge, or NeoForge source set and its loader jar. |
| All shippable loader artifacts | `verifyModIdentity` | Depends on all three loader `build` tasks, then inspects the expected Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge jars in their loader `build/libs` directories for fork identity. |

## Known automated gaps

The following gaps remain open until direct evidence closes them:

- the shared client/server `entity_block` classification path end to end;
- stale or display-hidden cancellation followed by authoritative rejection with
  no local fallback;
- real input-callback and render-frame behavior for rapid/deferred long-press
  compatibility;
- compatibility create-only dispatch conformance: the controller currently
  receives an action result rather than an explicit successful-dispatch outcome.
  A courtesy-rejected `CreatePing` can therefore still look qualifying even
  though the limiter/dispatcher did not track or hand it to the sender; the
  deferred path can also launch after a non-`CreatePing` result such as
  `TargetGone`. This action-versus-dispatch defect is not intended behavior;
  the pending regression matrix below specifies the required checks;
- live GUI/screen input callbacks and physical key-repeat behavior across
  Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge, beyond the input-state seams; and
- the complete range pipeline across native, Distant Horizons, Create/Sable,
  packet transport, and authoritative acceptance;
- live server-settings UI, permission, request/response, update, and persistence
  behavior;
- direct runtime proof that valid legacy S2C locations are presentation no-ops,
  plus live loader registration/network transport; and
- the complete `ServerCore` operation ordering and channel/admission matrix in
  an end-to-end server path;
- application of synchronized rate policy on reconnect and on effective live
  configuration change;
- server-side sanitization of negative rate-policy values; and
- detailed diagnostic behavior in the private
  `CreateEntityOutlineAdapter.EntityDiagnostics` path.

Render-entity lookup gaps remain for same-dimension world unload/rejoin and
runtime-ID reuse in a game session, shared epochs between real HUD and outline
callers, and integration proof that non-render callers bypass render-path cache
results. No automated evidence currently establishes CPU frame cost or
allocation behavior for one, ten, or fifty entity marks in a dense world at high
frame rates.

### Pending long-press compatibility regression matrix

| Scenario | Required regression assertion |
| --- | --- |
| Courtesy limiter rejects the first default `CreatePing`, then a rapid second press occurs | No rapid candidate or virtual capture begins; the dropped request is not queued, retried, or replayed. |
| Courtesy limiter rejects the first default `CreatePing`, then a deferred fresh press is present | No deferred capture begins; the dropped request is not queued, retried, or replayed. |
| A first result is `TargetGone` or another non-`CreatePing` while a deferred fresh press is present | The deferred press is discarded and no ordinary capture starts. |

### Sable-specific gaps

Sable-specific gaps remain for:

- installed-Sable API compatibility and client capture/presentation against a
  live sublevel, including the established
  [logical-anchor/render-pose boundary](../integrations/sable.md#client-capture-and-presentation);
- provider materialization, tracking-point reference counting, rollback and
  release, including the existing empty-audience cleanup path documented under
  [server validation and materialization](../integrations/sable.md#server-validation-and-materialization);
- live-sublevel refresh through the documented available, temporarily
  unavailable, and invalid outcomes in the
  [refresh lifecycle](../integrations/sable.md#refresh-lifecycle); and
- end-to-end server-authoritative names, fail-soft behavior, and multiplayer
  marker synchronization at the boundaries owned by
  [Sable](../integrations/sable.md#names-permissions-and-diagnostics) and
  [target validation](../authority/target_validation.md).

Coverage of Flywheel diagnostics or another adapter's diagnostic helper does
not close the private `EntityDiagnostics` gap.

## Pending manual and integration matrix

No scenario in this matrix is recorded as performed merely because it is listed
or because related automated tests exist.

| Area | Pending scenarios |
| --- | --- |
| Block | Plain `block` versus `entity_block`; `ALL`/`COMPATIBLE`/`VOXEL_SHAPE_ONLY` modes and source fallback; whitelist native glow and fallback; a non-full native shape; same-type state change versus block-type replacement. |
| Entity | Ordinary entity and dropped item; movement and same-dimension teleportation; death and disappearance; same-dimension world unload/rejoin and runtime-ID reuse in a game session. |
| Wheel | Short and long press; every sector and border color; configured timeout; frozen target; location fallback. |
| Selection policy and input | Live GUI/screen callbacks for selection gating; physical key-repeat behavior on Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge; selection toggles, entity blacklist/default `simulated:honey_glue` rule, and spectator exclusion in a game session. |
| Movement, death and replacement | Target movement while the wheel is open; entity death or dimension change; block state change or replacement while open. |
| Naming and chat | Custom-name formatting; localized base names; item naming; phrase-only text color. |
| Cancellation | Cone and nearest-own-marker selection; inability to cancel another player's marker; stale/display-hidden candidate followed by server rejection with no local fallback. |
| Multiplayer and protocol | Same-target latest-server-arrival winner; equal-arrival larger-Marker-ID tie; winner fallback after removal or expiry; complete `ServerCore` ordering/channel matrix; all-loader authoritative transport and ignored valid legacy S2C location. |
| Settings and config | External edits do not reload in-session and apply after restart or explicit reload; invalid-config recovery and preservation lock; live server-settings open/correlation/permission/edit/update/persistence flow. |
| Range | Native minimum, Distant Horizons route, Create/Sable finite-segment reuse, and server acceptance in one client/server pipeline. |
| Rate policy | Synchronization on reconnect and on effective live configuration change. |
| Optional content and rendering | Absent or partially present optional content; Create/Flywheel routes; occlusion and arbitrary camera angles; current shape, offset and seed. |
| Render entity lookup | A real frame epoch shared by HUD marker updates and optional outlines; fresh non-render lookups after render misses; CPU-frame and allocation measurements for 1, 10, and 50 entity marks in a dense world at high FPS. |
| Create contraption raycast | Hollow, sparse and overlapping contraptions; world-wall ordering; all transparent/fluid policy combinations including waterlogging; moving/rotated, minecart-mounted, carriage and gantry forms; portal-hidden or loading data; held press-time target; Create-absent and delegate-unavailable paths; large-structure press cost. |
| Sable external blocks | An installed-Sable client/server session covering [candidate capture and presentation](../integrations/sable.md#client-capture-and-presentation), [server materialization and release](../integrations/sable.md#server-validation-and-materialization) after removal, expiry, owner disconnect, and empty-audience cleanup, [live-sublevel refresh outcomes](../integrations/sable.md#refresh-lifecycle), names and fail-soft behavior, and multiplayer create, refresh, and removal. |

## Recording future evidence

- Add or update focused tests in the same change as behavior where practical.
- Record a gap as closed only when a named automated check or an actually
  performed manual/integration scenario covers it.
- Keep automated coverage, commands actually run, and manual observations as
  separate claims in implementation reports.
- Update the owning topic contract when expected behavior changes; changing a
  test alone does not redefine the product.
- Do not convert pending manual scenarios into completed validation based on
  compilation, document review, optional-API loading or unit-test seams alone.
