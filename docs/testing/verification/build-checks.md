## Build, source-set and artifact verification

The included Gradle projects are `common`, `fabric`, `forge`, and `neoforge`.
Their loader source sets receive common Java and resources through the shared
loader wiring. Fabric retains the common mixin configuration and Loom-generated
intermediary refmap; Forge and NeoForge use their loader-local official-Mojmap
configuration instead. This routing identifies existing tasks and artifact
purposes only; because each loader source set compiles the shared common
sources, an affected loader `build` is source-set and compile evidence for
those units, not runtime, transport, or in-game verification. Fabric and Forge
additionally carry a test source set whose headless native-wrapper seam tests
remain seam evidence only, not loader-launch, mixin-application or in-game
evidence. Public build
orientation and commands are listed in the
[repository README](../../../README.md#install-build-and-verify); the tracked
[geometry pipeline](../../architecture/geometry/geometry-pipeline.md) is the public
architecture entry point. Local agent instructions, when present, are
supplementary execution guidance rather than a public documentation prerequisite.

An inventory entry or static wiring test is not a Gradle execution record.
No separately configured lint, formatter, or static-analysis task exists; the
automated checks are the Gradle test tasks and the loader build and
artifact-identity tasks below. Final-state evidence for an implementation
change must identify the combined
tree, commands and results for the affected tests and loader source sets;
blocked or unrun tests, builds and artifact checks remain explicit gaps in that
change's report. Earlier runs do not validate subsequent relevant edits.

Captured combined-tree evidence includes passing headless suites, main/test
compilation, Javadoc generation, loader builds and `verifyModIdentity`. These
results establish automated test/build and configured artifact-identity evidence
for their identified inputs, not independent package-content or shipped-namespace
validation. Separately exercised named-host Mixin probes use their own captured
compiled inputs. Package-content and namespace audits and live validation require
distinct evidence; neither automated builds nor isolated probes substitute for
them. Exact commands, counts and execution history belong in the change's
external evidence report, not this coverage inventory.

| Module or artifact scope | Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `common` test source set | `:common:test` | Runs the common JUnit Platform tests, including shared behavior and integration seams. |
| `fabric` test source set | `:fabric:test` | Runs the Fabric JUnit Platform tests for the native platform wrapper seams headlessly. |
| `forge` test source set | `:forge:test` | Runs the Forge JUnit Platform tests for the native platform wrapper seams headlessly. |
| `neoforge` test source set | `:neoforge:test` | Runs the NeoForge JUnit Platform tests, including NeoForge-specific resolver coverage. |
| Affected loader source set | `:fabric:build`, `:forge:build`, or `:neoforge:build` | Builds the affected Fabric, Forge, or NeoForge source set and its loader jar. |
| All shippable loader artifacts | `verifyModIdentity` | Depends on all three loader `build` tasks, then inspects the expected Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge jars in their loader `build/libs` directories for fork identity. |
